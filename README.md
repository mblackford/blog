# 🛠️ Matt Blackford - Technical Blog

Welcome to my public technical blog where I share insights, solutions, and architectural patterns from my work in **cloud infrastructure**, **DevOps**, and **engineering leadership**.

I write these posts to:
- Share hard-won lessons from real-world systems.
- Demonstrate practical solutions, often with supporting code.
- Encourage and level-up others in the DevOps and cloud-native space.
